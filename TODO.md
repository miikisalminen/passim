# What is Passim?

Passim is an open source self-hosted webapplication that enables teams to stay connected while on the field.

## Core ideas
Passim has 2 different kinds of users.

1. Handler
This user is responsible for administrative tasks. The tool allows the user to:
- Create or modify Jobs
- Manage Agents in his/her Team

2. Agents
This user is responsible to carry out practical tasks. The tool allows the user to:
- Inspect, Fail and Complete Jobs
- Communicate with Handler

[!EXAMPLE] Use cases

A moving company uses Passim within their team. Their Handler schedules in Jobs for the week, all with their own specifications. Arranging Agents to their Jobs. Huge moves require more time and more Agents. Smaller moves get done faster and with fewer hands.

Similiar with plumbing, catering, construction, delivery etc. Here and there, everywhere. Passim.

Additionally, Passim has two core entities

1. Jobs
These are specifications on the practical work that needs to be done
- What, when, where, why

2. Teams
